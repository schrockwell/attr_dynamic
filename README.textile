h1. attr_dynamic

Fancy, flexible key-value coding for Rails. Awful code; not for use by anyone.

h2. lolwut

Check out the User model.

<pre><code>attr_dynamic :name, :string
attr_dynamic :height, :integer
attr_dynamic :birthday, :datetime

validates_presence_of :name</pre></code>

h2. Stuff to try

Run @rails console@ and play around:

<pre><code># Create a new user
user = User.new
user.name = 'Herp Derpington'
user.height = 6
user.birthday = DateTime.now
user.save

# See WTF that user looks like
user # => #<User id: 1, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil || name: "Herp Derpington", height: 6, birthday: Fri, 27 Apr 2012 01:53:36 -0400> 
user.inspect
DynamicAttribute.count # => 3

# Null out the user height
user.height = nil
user.save

# Check out our user model again. We only have 2 dynamic_attribute rows now
user # => #<User id: 1, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil || name: "Herp Derpington", height: nil, birthday: Fri, 27 Apr 2012 01:53:36 -0400> 
DynamicAttribute.count # => 2</code></pre>

Pretty nifty, huh? Currently supports string, datetime, and integer data types.

You can also use @validates_presence_of@.

h2. This code sucks

Don't use it on any projects. It's mostly a proof-of-concept.
